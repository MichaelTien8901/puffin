# Part 4: Alpha Factors

If the whole stock market goes up 10%, that rising tide lifts every boat. But what if your portfolio goes up 15%? That extra 5% is your "alpha" — your edge. This section is about finding those edges: patterns in data that help predict which stocks will do better (or worse) than average. Think of it as detective work — sifting through prices, financial reports, and trading volume to find clues that most people miss.
