    "1. **Custom lexicon**: Add domain-specific terms to `LexiconSentiment` (e.g., \"tapering\" as negative, \"dovish\" as positive) and re-score the Fed-related headlines.\n",
    "2. **Topic sweep**: Use `find_optimal_topics` on the earnings transcripts with `min_topics=2, max_topics=6`. Plot the coherence/variance curve.\n",
    "3. **Classifier evaluation**: Split the training headlines into train/test sets, fit `NewsClassifier`, and call `evaluate()` to inspect precision, recall, and F1.\n",
    "4. **Embedding analogies**: With a larger corpus, try `Word2VecTrainer.analogy(positive=['bullish', 'decline'], negative=['bearish'])` and inspect the result.\n",
    "5. **End-to-end signal**: Combine sentiment scores with topic weights into a single alpha signal and feed it into the Puffin backtester."
